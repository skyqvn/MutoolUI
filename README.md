# MutoolUI

## What is it?

This is a PDF processing software based on Mutool, which supports PDF format conversion, image generation, merge PDF, poster segmentation and other functions.

I started developing it because I couldn't remember Mutool commands. But then I found out that PDFgear was better, so the project was a bit of a "bad finish".

PDFgear is still recommended.

## Use

It's easy to use in general, and you don't need to look at in-app help.

Bold is mandatory, others are optional. Follow the prompts in the box.
